# 0nlyArg0ns2 External ImGui Tool

The 0nlyArg0ns2 External ImGui Tool is a customizable external overlay built with ImGui and DirectX 11. This tool is designed to provide users with an efficient, easy-to-use interface to enhance their gaming experience. With a focus on flexibility, it allows for a wide range of adjustments and additions, while remaining lightweight and transparent. It’s perfect for players who want to tweak their gameplay experience without intrusive modifications or performance hits.

At the core of the tool lies the ImGui framework, which enables a responsive and intuitive user interface. The tool currently includes essential features, such as crosshair customization and overlay settings, but it is designed with scalability in mind to accommodate future enhancements and new features.

# Features:

    ImGui-based Overlay: The tool provides a lightweight and transparent overlay that seamlessly integrates with most games without affecting performance. The overlay can be customized to meet specific user preferences.
    Crosshair Customization: Users can enable or disable the crosshair overlay and adjust its size, color, and visibility. This feature is perfect for players who need a precise aiming aid without cluttering their screen.
    Circle Overlay: A circle can be overlaid on the screen, with customizable size and color, offering additional visual aids to enhance gameplay or provide visual feedback.
    Organized Tab Interface: The tool includes a tabbed layout for easy navigation between different settings. It currently offers options for crosshair customization, with more tabs and features planned for the future.
    Window Transparency & Size Customization: The overlay window is transparent, ensuring that it doesn’t obstruct important in-game elements. Additionally, the window size is customizable for further flexibility.

# Future Goals:

    The development of new in-game features such as performance monitoring, aimbot functionalities, and ESP (Extra Sensory Perception) overlays.
    Improved customization options, with more detailed control over overlays, crosshairs, and other visual elements.
    Enhanced stability and broader compatibility with different games and system configurations.
